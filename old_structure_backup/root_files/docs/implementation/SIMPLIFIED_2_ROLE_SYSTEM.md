## ✅ Updated Role Structure

Your unified dashboard now uses a **simplified 2-role system** as requested:

// Before: Complex role checking
const isOwnerOrAdmin = user?.role === 'owner' || user?.role === 'admin';

// After: Simple role checking
const isOwnerOrAdmin = user?.role === 'admin';
```

### **Backend Model Updated:**
```python
# Before: 3 roles
role = Column(String(20), nullable=False, default='manager')  # owner, admin, manager

# After: 2 roles
role = Column(String(20), nullable=False, default='manager')  # admin, manager
