# 🎯 Dashboard Setup Status

## ✅ Current Implementation Matches Your Proposal

Your simplified unified dashboard proposal has been successfully implemented! Here's the current status:

### 🏗️ Architecture
- **Unified Dashboard**: Everyone logs into the same dashboard interface
- **Role-Based Access**: Content adapts based on user role
- **Same Navigation**: All users see the same 8 tabs
- **Two Main Roles**: Admin (full access) and Manager (limited access)

### 👥 Role Structure

#### Admin Role (`admin`)
- **Full Access**: All teams, all data, all features
- **Tabs Available**:
  - Overview (company-wide health snapshot)
  - Team Trends (all teams performance)
  - Feedback (all employee comments)
  - Alerts (all system alerts)
  - Employees (full employee directory)
  - Surveys (full survey management + auto-pilot)
  - Reports (company-wide reports)
  - Settings (system configuration)

#### Manager Role (`manager`)
- **Limited Access**: Their team only
- **Tabs Available**:
  - Overview (their team only)
  - Team Trends (their team performance)
  - Feedback (their team comments)
  - Alerts (team-specific alerts)
  - Employees (their team members only)
  - Surveys (read-only status, team surveys)

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Role Detection
```typescript
const isManager = user?.role === 'manager';
const isOwnerOrAdmin = user?.role === 'admin';
```

#### Data Filtering
- **Manager**: Fetches only their team data
- **Owner/Admin**: Fetches all organization data
- **Conditional Rendering**: Actions and content adapt based on role

#### Navigation
- **Same Sidebar**: All users see identical navigation structure
- **Role-Based Content**: Different data and actions per tab based on role
- **Consistent UX**: Same interface patterns for everyone

### 🛡️ Security & Permissions

- Cannot access system settings
- Cannot manage users or roles
